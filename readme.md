###The Wolf's Head Coffee App 
For Project 2, I decided to try and design an app with real-world implementation potential. My company is in the process of launching a coffee wholesale and delivery service, so I wanted to get as close as I could to a fully functional site for it. 

This project was built with Rails 4. Balsamiq was utilized for the wireframe diagram. In addition to the bundled gems, I installed bcrypt for encryption, bootstrap & sass for styling, figaro to protect keys, and aws-sdk in anticipation of users uploading photos. I utilized Postgres for my server from creation. I followed the bash console creation methods (rails g new, rails g new model, rails g new migration, etc). To install, fork down, and run bundle install in the terminal. Initially, I had installed the Stripe Gem to process recurring subscription payments, but after determining that the installation of the gem had been corrupted, I moved on. In order to accurately represent a one to many model relationship, I began to build a blog after fully styling my page. As of presentation time, when a customer makes a new post, it appears on the customer show page, but it does not render on the blog index page yet. Overall, I am pleased with my project. It is my first full-stack app, and I am very happy with the initial concept, the site's layout, and the knowledge I gained while building it. Considering that coffee is consumed by 2/3rds of the U.S. population, I did not find it necessary to make user stories.
