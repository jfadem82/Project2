<p>Wolf's Head Santa Barbara was established in December, 2014 by brothers Cristian and Ruben Sagastume. The brothers shared a love for high-end men's fashion, and sought to bring a unique shopping experience unlike any other available in Santa Barbara at the time.
With a budget that would make a less resourceful entrepreneur cry like a baby, the two created an exquisite shopping experience, complete with hardwood floors, exposed brick walls, and vintage furniture. Taking it a step further, Cris and Ruben partnered with Richie's Barbershop in Montecito, and incorporated a barber chair on the sales floor, something never seen before in boutiques, even in larger metropolitan areas such as New York and Los Angeles. </p>
<p>In April of 2015, Cris and Ruben brought Josh Fadem on board as a third partner. Josh's previous operational and managerial experience was a welcome addition to the team.</p>
<p>Around the same time, Ruben traveled to Guatemala to visit his cousins, who have been in the coffee business for generations, growing, roasting, and blending a product that nearly 2/3rds of American adults consume at least once daily. Armed with his new knowledge of the business, and a family connection in the industry that most could only wish to have, Ruben returned to Santa Barbara eager to start a new endeavor bearing the Wolf's Head brand.</p><p> "After some brainstorming and market research, we determined that the current 'craft' and 'gourmet' coffee subscriptions were too cost-prohibitive for anyone other than fedora-wearing trustafarians to enjoy, and decided to shake up the industry", according to Fadem. "We believe that quality, organic coffee delivery should not be a privilege reserved for the $100k plus crowd, and strive to bring the same standards of quality to people from all walks of life. After all, whether you're a hedge fund manager or a construction worker, chances are you start your day the same way: With a hot cup of coffee. To our competitors, we would like to introduce you to Wolf's Head Coffee, a new standard in wholesale and direct-to-consumer coffee. We're better than you. And less expensive. Roll with us, or get rolled over."
